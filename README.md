# LearnPiano

Python Version 3.6.5

pip install pygame

Piano Requirement:

      - Compatiable General MIDI USB connected piano 
      
      - My piano is a CASIO CTK-2400 and it currently works specifically for my piano. Plan on making it more general in the future. 
      
LearnPiano.py is the master file to run the program:

  - SheetMusicModels.py - model

  - Illustrations.py - view
  
  - GameModes.py - controller
  
  - point.py facilitates view implementation. (This file was written by my professor Alex Thornton for ICS 32 at UCI Winter 2017)
